Pulled from Parmageddon's readme:
Parmageddon!

A small app made by me for me to demonstrate my progress after several months of self-taught web development, and completion of the Le Wagon web dev coding bootcamp.

The gist of the app is to give visitors insights into VISITOR generated ratings and reviews for Parma (Chicken Parmigiana for anyone outside of Aus!) offerings at pubs near to them.

Content will be created slowly for a little while.. If I'm comfortable with the project at a certain point, I may unleash it into the wild. From that point content will be added so long as I imagine ideas.
